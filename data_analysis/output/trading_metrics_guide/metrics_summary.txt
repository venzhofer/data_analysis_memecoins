📊 BASIC TRADING METRICS:
• Return (%): Percentage change in investment value
  Example: If 0.5 SOL becomes 1.0 SOL, return = +100%

• Maximum Drawdown (%): Largest peak-to-trough decline in investment value
  Example: If investment drops from 1.0 SOL to 0.6 SOL, drawdown = 40%

• Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted return measure
  Example: Sharpe > 1.0 = good, > 2.0 = excellent

• Volatility: Measure of price/investment variability
  Example: High volatility = large price swings

• Win Rate (%): Percentage of profitable trades
  Example: 8 wins out of 10 trades = 80% win rate
